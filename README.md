# A library for Jenkins pipelines that addresses common checks in SQA environments

## Motivation
The library contains common functionalities that are needed for the
implementation of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) requirements in Jenkins
CI/CD pipelines.

## Library content
The library consists in a set of Groovy scripts that interface with popular
tools to carry out agile software developement and CI/CD environment setup.
The Groovy scripts make use of documented Jenkins plugins that need to be
available beforehand in Jenkins service.

 * Automated testing (tox, maven)
 * Reporting (checkstyle, cobertura, PEP8, JUnit)
 * Metrics gathering (sloc)
 * Artifact building (Docker, RPM/DEB)
 * Delivery (Docker Hub)
 * Issue tracking (JIRA, RT)
 * Notifications (e-mails)

## Usage

Just import the library at the beginning of your Jenkinsfile:

```
@Library(['github.com/indigo-dc/jenkins-pipeline-library']) _
```

or use a specific version of the library:
```
@Library(['github.com/indigo-dc/jenkins-pipeline-library@1.0.0']) _
```

__Documentation in groovydoc format is available
[here](https://indigo-dc.github.io/jenkins-pipeline-library/) for each
supported version.__

## Contributing

Jenkins CI/CD pipelines are often similar in the type of actions that are
triggered. It then makes sense to have a common library for tackling them,
covering different programming languages and interfaces to software lifecycle
management tools.

Contributions are really welcome. Please check our
[contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
